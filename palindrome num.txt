Context:
In the fantasy adventure game, "Chronicles of Numeria," players embark on 
quests that involve solving numerical puzzles to unlock ancient secrets and 
treasures. One of the key challenges is identifying palindromic numbers to 
open magical gates and chests. A palindrome is a number that reads the same 
forward and backward, such as 121 or 3443. The game needs a reliable and 
efficient tool to check if a given number is a palindrome to ensure smooth and 
engaging gameplay.
Scenario:
Players of "Chronicles of Numeria" frequently encounter enchanted doors and 
chests that require them to enter palindromic numbers to proceed. To maintain 
the game's immersive experience, the game engine must quickly and 
accurately determine if the numbers entered by players are palindromes. This 
requires a robust algorithm that can handle various inputs and provide instant 
feedback.


n=int(input("enter num: "))
temp=n
rev=0
while n>0:
    rem=n%10
    rev=rev*10+rem
    n=n//10
if temp==rev:
    print("palindrome num")
else:
    print("not palindrome num")
